\title{Estimates of composite pairwise LD based either on genotype estimates or
genotype likelihoods.}
\usage{
ldest_comp(ga, gb, K, pen = 1, useboot = TRUE, nboot = 50, se = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ga}{One of two possible inputs: (i) A vector of counts, containing
the genotypes for each individual at the first locus; or (ii)
A matrix of genotype log-likelihoods at the first locus. The rows
index the individuals and the columns index the genotypes.
That is \code{ga[i, j]} is the genotype likelihood of individual
\code{i} for genotype \code{j}. When \code{type = "comp"}, the
vector of genotypes may be continuous (e.g. the posterior mean
genotype).}

\item{gb}{One of two possible inputs: (i) A vector of counts, containing
the genotypes for each individual at the second locus; or (ii) A
matrix of genotype log-likelihoods at the second locus. The rows
index the individuals and the columns index the genotypes.
That is \code{ga[i, j]} is the genotype likelihood of individual
\code{i} for genotype \code{j}. When \code{type = "comp"}, the
vector of genotypes may be continuous (e.g. the posterior mean
genotype).}

\item{K}{The ploidy of the species. Assumed the same for all individuals.}

\item{pen}{The penalty to be applied to the likelihood. You can think about
this as the prior sample size. Should be greater than 1.}

\item{useboot}{Should we use bootstrap standard errors \code{TRUE} or not
\code{FALSE}? Only applicable if using genotype likelihoods.}

\item{nboot}{The number of bootstrap iterations to use is
\code{boot = TRUE}.}

\item{se}{A logical. Should we calculate standard errors (\code{TRUE}) or
not (\code{FALSE}). Calculating standard errors can be really slow
when \code{type = "comp"} and when using gentoype likelihoods. Otherwise,
standard error calculations should be pretty fast.}
}
\value{
A vector with some or all of the following elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{D}}{The estimate of the LD coefficient.}
\item{\code{D_se}}{The standard error of the estimate of
the LD coefficient.}
\item{\code{r2}}{The estimate of the squared Pearson correlation.}
\item{\code{r2_se}}{The standard error of the estimate of the
squared Pearson correlation.}
\item{\code{r}}{The estimate of the Pearson correlation.}
\item{\code{r_se}}{The standard error of the estimate of the
Pearson correlation.}
\item{\code{Dprime}}{The estimate of the standardized LD
coefficient.}
\item{\code{Dprime_se}}{The standard error of the estimate of the
standardized LD coefficient.}
\item{\code{z}}{The Fisher-z transformation of \code{r}.}
\item{\code{z_se}}{The standard error of the Fisher-z
transformation of \code{r}.}
\item{\code{p_ab}}{The estimated haplotype frequency of ab.
Only returned if estimating the haplotypic LD.}
\item{\code{p_Ab}}{The estimated haplotype frequency of Ab.
Only returned if estimating the haplotypic LD.}
\item{\code{p_aB}}{The estimated haplotype frequency of aB.
Only returned if estimating the haplotypic LD.}
\item{\code{p_AB}}{The estimated haplotype frequency of AB.
Only returned if estimating the haplotypic LD.}
\item{\code{q_ij}}{The estimated frequency of genotype i at locus 1
and genotype j at locus 2. Only returned if estimating the
composite LD.}
}
}
\description{
This function will estimate the composite LD between two loci, either
using genotype estimates or using genotype likelihoods. The resulting
measures of LD are generalizations of Burrow's "composite" LD measure.
