\usage{
sldest(
  geno,
  K,
  win = 50,
  nc = 1,
  type = c("gam", "comp"),
  model = c("norm", "flex"),
  pen = ifelse(type == "gam", 2, 1),
  se = TRUE

}
\arguments{
\item{geno}{One of two possible inputs:
\itemize{
\item{A matrix of genotypes (allele dosages). The rows index the
SNPs and the columns index the individuals. That is,
\code{genomat[i, j]} is the allele dosage for individual
\code{j} in SNP \code{i}. When \code{type = "comp"}, the
dosages are allowed to be continuous (e.g. posterior
mean genotypes).}
\item{A three-way array of genotype \emph{log}-likelihoods.
The first dimension indexes the SNPs, the second dimension
indexes the individuals, and the third dimension indexes
the genotypes. That is, \code{genolike_array[i, j, k]}
is the genotype log-likelihood at SNP \code{i} for
individual \code{j} and dosage \code{k - 1}.}
}}

\item{K}{The ploidy of the species. Assumed to be the same for all
individuals.}

\item{win}{The window size. Pairwise LD will be estimated plus or minus
these many positions. Larger sizes significantly increase the
computational load.}

\item{nc}{The number of computing cores to use. This should never be
more than the number of cores available in your computing environment.
You can determine the maximum number of available cores by running
\code{parallel::detectCores()} in R. This is probably fine for a
personal computer, but some environments are only
able to use fewer. Ask your admins if you are unsure.}

\item{type}{The type of LD to calculate. The available types are
gametic LD (\code{type = "gam"}) or composite LD
(\code{type = "comp"}). Gametic LD is only appropriate for
autopolyploids when the individuals are in Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (HWE). The composite
measures of LD are always applicable, and consistently estimate the
usual measures of LD when HWE is fulfilled in autopolyploids.
However, when HWE is not fulfilled, interpreting the
composite measures of LD could be a little tricky.}

\item{model}{When \code{type = "comp"} and using genotype likelihoods,
should we use the proportional
bivariate normal model to estimate the genotype distribution
(\code{model = "norm"}), or the general categorical distribution
(\code{model = "flex"})? Defaults to \code{"norm"}.}

\item{pen}{The penalty to be applied to the likelihood. You can think about
this as the prior sample size. Should be greater than 1. Does not
apply if \code{model = "norm"}, \code{type = "comp"}, and using
genotype likelihoods. Also does not apply when \code{type = "comp"}
and using genotypes.}

\item{se}{A logical. Should we calculate standard errors (\code{TRUE}) or
not (\code{FALSE}). Calculating standard errors can be really slow
when \code{type = "comp"}, \code{model = "flex"}, and when using
genotype likelihoods. Otherwise, standard error calculations
should be pretty fast.}
